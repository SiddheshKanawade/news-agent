            summary="World leaders have achieved a landmark agreement at the Global Climate Summit held in Geneva, with representatives from more than 150 nations pledging concrete actions to combat climate change. The comprehensive accord sets ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, with participating countries committing to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The agreement includes specific provisions for transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy infrastructure, and protecting biodiversity. Developed nations have agreed to provide substantial financial support to help developing countries meet their climate goals, with a commitment of $500 billion in climate financing over the next decade. Environmental scientists have hailed the agreement as a crucial step forward, though many emphasize the need for immediate implementation and accountability mechanisms. The accord also addresses deforestation, ocean conservation, and sustainable agriculture practices. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres called it the most significant climate action agreement since the Paris Climate Accord, expressing cautious optimism about humanity's ability to address the climate crisis.",
